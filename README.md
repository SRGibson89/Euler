Due to a monday holiday at University we were asked to go to project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/archives) and select a problem.
Because i enjoyed doing the first i continued and did 6 more

Project 1 : Multiples of 3 and 5
Project 2 : Even Fibonacci numbers
Project 3 : Largest prime factor 
Project 4 : Largest palindrome product
Project 5 : Smallest multiple
Project 6 : Sum square difference
Project 7 : 10001st prime
